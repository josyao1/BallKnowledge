# Ball Knowledge

NBA + NFL roster trivia game. Name as many players as you can from a team's roster in a given season before the clock runs out.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

App runs at `http://localhost:5173`. No backend required — all data is served as static JSON from Vercel CDN.

## Game Modes

- **Roster Royale** — Solo or multiplayer. Guess players from a random or manually selected team/season.
- **Division Mode** — Multiplayer. Each player is assigned a different team from the same division.
- **Career Mode** — Identify a player from their season-by-season stat line.
- **Roll Call** — Open-ended multiplayer: name anyone who ever played for a franchise.

## Tech Stack

- React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
- Zustand (state management)
- Fuse.js (fuzzy search autocomplete)
- Supabase (multiplayer lobbies + leaderboard)
- Static JSON on Vercel CDN (all roster + career data)

## Environment Variables

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

Supabase is optional — the app works fully offline without it (multiplayer and leaderboard features are disabled).

## Static Data

All game data lives in `public/data/` and is pre-generated by scripts in `scripts/`:

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `public/data/rosters/` | ~775 NBA roster files (2000–01 through 2025–26) |
| `public/data/players/` | NBA league-wide autocomplete per season |
| `public/data/nfl/rosters/` | ~754 NFL roster files (2000–2025) |
| `public/data/nfl/players/` | NFL league-wide autocomplete per year |
| `public/data/nba_careers.json` | 736 NBA players, full season-by-season stats |
| `public/data/nfl_careers.json` | 584 NFL players (QB/RB/WR/TE) |

To regenerate or add new seasons:

```bash
cd scripts

# NBA rosters (resume-safe, skips existing files)
python generate_nba_rosters.py

# NFL rosters (fast — uses local nfl_data_py)
python generate_nfl_rosters.py

# Career stats (full rebuild)
python generate_nba_careers.py
python generate_nfl_careers.py

# NBA career incremental update (append new seasons only, much faster)
python update_nba_careers.py --years 2025 2026
```
